2013-09-12 - Snort 2.9.5.5

[*] Improvements
* Address issue with SMTP preprocessor and the ignore_tls_data configuration
  to correctly stop inspection after an SMTP session is encrypted.

* Disable all rule evaluation (as opposed to just rules with fast patterns)
  for packets on a previously blocked session.

* Corrected when perfmon preprocessor writes stats to occur as soon as
  both the time and packet count criteria are met.

* Enforce same restrictions on relative PCRE for HTTP buffers from
  shared library rules as already existed with text rules.

2013-07-22 - Snort 2.9.5.3

[*] Improvements
* Performance improvements to eliminate some unnecessary work, reduction
  of sizes of data structures, and cleanup of processing for HTTP normalized
  buffers.

* Cap the number of expected connections (eg FTP data channel) to prevent
  memory growth

* Address issue with reloading reputation lookup tables when more addresses
  are added.

* Address issue with potential hang during shutdown of control socket config
  reload processing thread.

2013-06-11 - Snort 2.9.5

[*] New additions

* Added tracking of FTP data channel for file transfers as file_data
  for Snort rules.

* Add support for doing PAF based on services loaded thru the
  attribute table and hardened PAF code/removed --disable-paf

* Added decoding support for Cisco ERSPAN

* Added tracking of HTTP uploads as file_data for Snort rules.

* Added ability to use event filters with PPM rules

* Added a control channel command to reload the Snort configuration to
  give feedback on new configuration.  This improves on the older sigHUP
  which would just result in Snort exiting and restarting if the new
  configuration required a restart.

* Added a configuration option to perfmon to write flow-ip data to a file

* New decoding alert for IPv6 Routing type 0 header.

* Added the ability to sync basic session state from one Snort to another
  via a side channel communication between the two Snort instances.  NOTE:
  This is currently experimental.

[*] Improvements

* Improved Stream's midstream pickup handling for TCP state processing,
  sequence validation, and reassembly. 

* Improved HTTP PAF reassembly capabilities to be better aligned on PDU
  boundaries, terminate if not actually HTTP, and to include all appropriate
  line feeds.

* Hardened the code related to dynamic modules.  Removed --disable-dynamicplugin
  configuration option since rule and preprocessor shared libraries are here
  to stay.

* Added a parse error for a rule if there is a relative content used
  after a content that is 'fast_pattern only'.

* Improved parsing of IP lists for reputation

* Update to Teredo processing and Snort rule evaluation when the inner
  IPv6 packet doesn't have payload

* Improved logging of packets associated with alerts when a Stream 
  reassembled packet triggers multiple Snort rules.

* Improvements to the Snort manual including documentation of specific rule
  options and configuration items.

* Removed a bunch of dead code paths, updated to use more current memory
  functions for easier code maintenance and portability.

[*] Deletions

* Remove deprecated unified support, use unified2 for all of your
  logging needs.
